# Troubleshooting

Follow this checklist to verify that your entire hardware and software
stack works (drivers, OpenCL, SILENTARMY).

## Driver / OpenCL installation

Run `clinfo` to list all the OpenCL devices. If it does not find all your
devices, something is wrong with your drivers and/or OpenCL stack. Uninstall
and reinstall your drivers. Here are good instructions:

## Check silentarmy

Does `./silentarmy --list` list your devices? If `clinfo` does, silentarmy
should list them as well.

## Basic operation 

Run the Equihash solver `sa-solver` to solve the all-zero block. It should
report 2 solutions. Specify the device ID to test with `--use ID`

```
$ ./sa-solver --use 0
Solving default all-zero 140-byte header
Building program
Hash tables will use 805.3 MB
Running...
Nonce 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000: 2 sols
Total 2 solutions in 205.3 ms (9.7 Sol/s)
```

Note that `sa-solver` only supports 1 device at a time. It will not recognize
eg. `--use 0,1,2`.

## Correct results

Verify that `make test` reports valid Equihash solutions for 100 different
blocks:

```
$ make test
./sa-solver --nonces 100 -v -v 2>&1 | grep Soln: | \
    diff -u testing/sols-100 - | cut -c 1-75
```

It should output nothing else. If you see a bunch of lines with numbers,
something is wrong with your hardware and/or drivers.

## Sustained operation on one device

Let the Equihash solver `sa-solver` run for multiple hours:

```
$ ./sa-solver --nonces 100000000
Solving default all-zero 140-byte header
Building program
Hash tables will use 1208.0 MB
Running...
Nonce 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000: 2 sols
Nonce 0100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000: 0 sols
...
```

It should not crash or hang.

## Mining

Run the miner without options. By default it will use the first device,
and connect to flypool with my donation address. These known-good parameters
should let you know easily if your machine can mine properly:

```
$ ./silentarmy
Connecting to us1-zcash.flypool.org:3333
Stratum server sent us the first job
Mining on 1 device
Total 0.0 sol/s [dev0 0.0] 0 shares
Total 48.9 sol/s [dev0 48.9] 1 share
Total 44.9 sol/s [dev0 44.9] 1 share
...
```

Verify that the number of shares increases over time.

## Performance

Not achieving the performance you expected?

* You might want to edit the `param.h` file, look for `OPTIM_SIMPLIFY_ROUND`,
  and set it to 1 (instead of 0). Then recompile with `make`. Depending on
  your exact drivers/hardware combination, it may boost performance by +25%,
  or decrease it. Just try it. It seems especially useful on Nvidia GPUs. Also,
  setting `OPTIM_SIMPLIFY_ROUND` to 1 will decrease GPU memory usage from
  1.2 GB per instance to 805 MB per instance.
* By default SILENTARMY mines with only one device/GPU; make sure to specify
  all the GPUs in the `--use` option, for example `silentarmy --use 0,1,2`
  if the host has three devices with IDs 0, 1, and 2.
* If a GPU has less than ~2.4 GB of GPU memory, run `silentarmy --instances 1`
  (1 instance uses ~1.2 GB of memory, 2 instances use ~2.4 GB of memory.)
* If 1 instance still requires too much memory, edit `param.h` and set
  `NR_ROWS_LOG` to `19` (this reduces the per-instance memory usage to ~670 MB)
  and run with `--instances 1`.
